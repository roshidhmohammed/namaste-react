<!-- Namaste React -->
### This repository contains the strong foundation behind the react library.

### Before deep diving into the react, let's go with some basic HTML and Javascript code.

1. What is Emmet?
      The Emmet is the foundation of the HTML structure for rendering the elements into the browser.

   eg: html:5  - With this command, it gives the below HTML code

   <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Document</title>
        </head>
     <body>
     </body>
    </html>
